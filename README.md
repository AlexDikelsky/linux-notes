Notes for learning how to use various programming utilities

The `shell_commands` folder has notes and examples on using 
`find`, `grep`, and others, while the compiled and interpreted folders
talk are about learning different languages. The esoteric folder
is for trying to understand less immediately useful but highly interesting languages.

The "notes" folder contains a small vim plugin for syntax highlighting for the notes themselves
