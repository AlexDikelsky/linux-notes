%You can group stuff with {}s
%If you define something inside a {}, it will become undefined outside of it
%This is like definig a scope and local variables/functions
%You can end stuff if you do \TeX{}, although {\TeX} looks nicer imo

%Ex 5.1
shelf{}ful

%Ex 5.2
start{ }{ }{ }end

%Ex 5.3
\centerline{This is {centered}}
\centerline This is not
\centerline{This is centered, and \it this is italicised}

%Ex 5.4
\def\ital#1{\it#1\/}

{\ital{asdfsdf} \rm sdfsdf}\par
{\it asdfsdf \rm sdfsdf}
%You don't have to remember, but it's less flexable.

%You can make stuff global
%\global\advance\count0 by 1
%Youn can also make named blocks like
\beginthe{beguine}\beginthe{inside}\endthe{inside}\endthe{beguine}
