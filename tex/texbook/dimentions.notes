When specifuing a font or an area like \hsize, you can use certain numbers to change stuff.
For instance, 

\hsize=20in %makes a column that is 20 inches long.
\vskip.5cm  %Skips .5 cm of space below whatever you typed
\vskip19pt  %Skip 19 points

You can also magnify the type of an entire document by saying
\magnification=2000
to double, 
\magnification=1000
for default, or
\magnification=500
to halve the normal value
