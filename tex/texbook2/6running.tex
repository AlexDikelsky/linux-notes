%Badness is a measure of how messed up a line is
%Change the margin size by
    %\hsize 1in
%You can change what the worst case is by doing
    %\tolerance=10000
%The max value is 10000
%You can also do 
    %\raggedright
%to get ragged right lines

%EX 6.5
%Find out sow much badness is applied to a particular line

\hsize 1.5in

%You can do \hfuzz=1pt to add more bounds on the length over the end of the right margin
